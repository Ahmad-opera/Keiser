                <p class="service-paragraph">If your teeth grow improperly either outward or inward, it will affect not only the way you eat or clean your teeth but also the decaying condition. In this situation, dental braces are definitely the path you should consider. Braces can help modify the angle of your teeth and align them in the correct way. However, this method takes time to affect, and the duration shortens the younger you are.</p>

                Orthodontic treatment has long been used to create esthetic smiles and improve function. But could orthodontia also provide underlying oral health benefits? Evidence suggests that uneven occlusal forces may increase the risk of premature tooth wear and periodontal diseases. Although more research is necessary to answer this question, it is biologically plausible that aligning maloccluded teeth could address the root of some of today’s most common dental problems, including occlusal trauma, tooth wear, noncarious lesions, and periodontitis.</p>
                <h3 class="text-subheading">Research Review</h3>
                <p class="service-paragraph">A systemic review on existing studies evaluating orthodontic treatment and periodontal outcomes has identified an absence of reliable evidence.26 The studies reviewed had potential for bias and were flawed. In some, no evaluations were taken at baseline or no follow-up of factors, such as oral hygiene regimen, socioeconomic status, or smoking, was provided. Other issues included lack of information on pretreatment periodontal status, reporting the number of subjects lost to follow-up, and missing data. Many participants were adolescents or young adults. Often, untreated controls had slight malocclusion. Very few studies included current orthodontic expansion methods. More epidemiologic studies with adequate comparison groups, specific techniques, and substantial follow-up are needed to fully understand the impact of orthodontic treatment on oral health.</p>
